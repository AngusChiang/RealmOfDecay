Future Updates
--------------

Armour System
 - Armour can resist damage from one weapon type, but take more damage from another.
 - Enemies drop armour in the same way they drop weapons, it is at the player's option to take it.
 - Armour has randomly determined resistance/weakness levels.
 - Typeless armour will appear rarely that blocks a certain level of all damage.
 - Damage absorption will be capped at a percentage of damage taken.
 - Armour can decay like weapons do.

Currency
 - Could be coins or something more post-apocalyptic (think bottle caps in Fallout).
 - Prices should be such that each level you gain enough currency to upgrade either your weapon or armour.
 - Gold gained from combat, and also from selling dropped enemy weapons and armour.

Naming
 - The following things should be named:
   - The player (decide on game start, can be changed at any time)
   - Enemies
     - Selected from a list based on weapon type and boss status
     - Rarely choose from a list of special names (including contributing Redditors)
   - Weapons
     - Depending on level, speed tier and weapon type
     - Named weapons are rare (and as such should command higher stats)

Layout
 - A single column layout which contains a number of tabs:
   - Main tab, which contains the actions a player can take
   - Store tab, which allows the player to upgrade their items
   - Combat tab, which contains the player/enemy stat outputs and combat log
 - Consider bootstrap (thanks /u/seiyria)

Story (low priority)
 - Some way of motivating the player to actually play the game.
