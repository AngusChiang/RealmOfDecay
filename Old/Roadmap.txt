Slated for Version 0.25 alpha
-----------------------------

Inventory and Upgrades
----------------------

 - An inventory tab containing an arbitrary number of weapons (20 as a first guess), which can be equipped, sold or scrapped as required.
 - Selling a weapon generates an amount of currency based on the weapon's level and quality.
 - Scrapping a weapon generates an amount of scrap - the amount based on weapon quality ONLY
   - 0 scrap for POOR weapons
   - 1-2 scrap for NORMAL weapons
   - 2-3 scrap for GOOD weapons
   - 3-5 scrap for GREAT weapons
   - 7-10 scrap for AWESOME weapons

The Store
---------

 - Enemies will drop currency based on their level and the level of their weapons. Bosses will drop twice as much as a normal enemy of the same level and weapon level.
 - This currency can be spent to increase the level of a carried weapon, up to a cap dictated by the player's level and weapon quality. This will make weapons easier to keep for long periods.
 - A combination of currency and scrap can be used to increase a weapon's quality tier. This should be very costly on the scrap front.
 - A small number of weapons will be available in the store for purchase with currency.

Future Updates
--------------

Armour System
 - Armour can resist damage from one weapon type, but take more damage from another.
 - Enemies drop armour in the same way they drop weapons, it is at the player's option to take it.
 - Armour has randomly determined resistance/weakness levels.
 - Typeless armour will appear rarely that blocks a certain level of all damage.
 - Damage absorption will be capped at a percentage of damage taken.
 - Armour can decay like weapons do.


Naming
 - The following things should be named:
   - The player (decide on game start, can be changed at any time)
   - Enemies
     - Selected from a list based on weapon type and boss status
     - Rarely choose from a list of special names (including contributing Redditors)
   - Weapons
     - Depending on level, speed tier and weapon type
     - Named weapons are rare (and as such should command higher stats)

Story (low priority)
 - Some way of motivating the player to actually play the game.
