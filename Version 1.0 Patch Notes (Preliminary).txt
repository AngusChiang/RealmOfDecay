#Realm of Decay - Planned Patch Notes - v1.0 (The Big Kahuna)

**Warning: This patch will come with a progress wipe. It'll all be worth it, trust me...**
   
 - **Repair Mechanics**
   - The 'Repair' option will be activated as a toggle from the 'Inventory' tab.
   - While the 'Repair' option is active, the player's equipped weapon and armour will gain 5 durability per tick (plus 1 per 5 player levels), capping at the usual amount based on item level.
   - Players will be able to change their equipment while the 'Repair' operation is active, and the newly equipped item will be repaired instead.
   - Players will be able to enter combat while the 'Repair' operation is active, which will disable said option.
   
 - **New Powers**
   - 'Master Tinkerer' will increase the durability restored per repair tick by 20% per rank, have 5 ranks, require maximum investment in 'Proper Care', and will not be usable alongside 'Hanging By a Thread' or 'High Maintenance'.
   - 'Reclaimed Knowledge' will increase experience gains by up to 50% by draining the excess from the experience overflow pool, have 1 rank, and not require any other powers to unlock.
   - 'Alchemical Attunement' will lower the cooldown on potions by 1 second per rank, have 10 ranks, and not require any other powers to unlock.
   - 'Master Alchemist' will grant a 2% chance per level to increase the potency of a potion's effect when used, have 5 ranks, and require maximum investment in 'Alchemical Attunement' to use.
 
 - **Changed Powers**
   - 'Luck of the Draw' and 'Lucky Star' will have their effects swapped - 'Lucky Star' will grant power points, whereas 'Luck of the Draw' will grant skill points. Their positions in the powers tree will remain the same.
   - 'Thorough Looting' now has a chance to grant a random potion to the player instead of a piece of scrap.
 
 - **The Store**
   - The 'Store' tab will make a return, as a repository to buy items to aid in the player's adventures. 
   - The 'Store' tab will contain 6 weapons and 6 pieces of armour that are randomly generated - with at least one item guaranteed to be of 'Good' quality or better.
   - Shop stocks will be refreshed once every 10 minutes. There will be a timer on the 'Shop' tab to show this.
   - Additionally, the 'Store' tab will play host to a new set of items: potions.
     - Healing potions will be available that restore a percentage of the drinker's health.
     - There will be a set of potions that apply the usual gamut of debuffs to an enemy independently of the player's equipped weapon.
     - These debuffs will not stack with any existing applied debuffs from the player's weapon.
	 - All potions will have a 30 second cooldown.
	 - The price of potions in the store will scale with player level.
	 - Debuff potions to be named as follows (subject to change)
     - Acidic Solution (Armour Shred for 10 sec)
     - Twinstrike Tonic (Double Attack for 10 sec)
     - Vampiric Infusion (Health Drain for 10 sec)
     - Frostblood Draught (Slowed Attacks for 10 sec)
     - Cupid's Charm Chalice (Charm for 10 sec)
     - Nightshade Potion (Damage over Time for 10 sec)
     - Mind-Numbing Mix (Paralysis for 10 sec)
     - Bottled Heart Attack (Doom)
     - Butterfinger Brew (Disarm for 10 sec)
     - Chloroform Concoction (Sleep for 10 sec)
 
 - **UI Changes**
   - The left sidebar will be removed from the game and the game width set at 1000 pixels (up from 900)
   - The tab bar will be placed at the top of the page, replacing the 'Realm of Decay' title bar.
   - All items will have new, consistent information boxes displayed around the UI. The bottom section of these boxes is context-sensitive based on where they are shown in the interface (so for example they have sell/scrap controls on the Inventory tab and upgrade controls on the Forge tab)
   - The health bars have been de-coupled from the 'Combat' tab and are now visible at the top of every interface tab.
   - A new 'Player' tab will be added to hold information that was previously stored on the left sidebar, including the 'Repair' button for equipped items.
   - In accordance with the ability to reset stat point allocations, the existing stat point allocation UI will be updated.
 
 - **Miscellaneous Changes**
   - The player will now be able to set their own name.
   - The player's autobattle configuration will now persist between page loads.
   - The player will be able to reset their stat point allocation at any time, at a cost of 1 scrap for every 5 points available and spent.
   - The experience and levelling curve will be significantly lowered.
   
 - **Prestige**
   - The player will be able to reset all of their current progress to start over from level 1 with a new set of random items.
   - The level that the player reached will be stored, and used for any calculations of experience and seed gains.
   - On top of this, the player will receive one Stat Point for every level gained during their last playthrough.
   - Achievements and the related boost in experience gain will still apply after a prestige reset.
 
 - **Statistics Tracking**
   - The following information will now be tracked and shown on the 'Player' page:
     - Total / Melee / Ranged / Magic damage dealt
     - Total / Melee / Ranged / Magic damage taken
     - Number of attacks dealt / taken
