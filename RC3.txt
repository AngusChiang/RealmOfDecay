Realm of Decay v1.0.1
---------------------

  • Skill Rework
    • The skill trees have been redefined, and split into three broad categories:
      • The Offense tree focuses on skills that increase damage done and effects that occur when attacking.
      • The Defence tree focuses on skills that decrease damage taken and effects that occur when attacked.
      • The Support tree focuses on quality of life upgrades that don't fit into either of the above trees.
    • The 'Intuition' skill is now called 'Undermine'.
    • The 'Will to Live' skill has been renamed to 'Victory Rush' and now restores 5% health per rank when you defeat an enemy.
    • The 'Survival Instincts' skill now directly increases the repair and regen values instead of increasing the frequency of repair ticks.
    • All badges relating to reaching maximum levels with particular skills have been removed.
    • Previous restrictions on which skills can be purchased together have been removed, except for the split between 'Absorption Shield' and 'Reflective Shield'.
