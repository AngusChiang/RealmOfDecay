                      <td>
                        <div class="powerHeader">Introduction</div>

                        <p>Remember that old saying, 'war never changes'? Yea, the guys who came up with that never banked on the ground breaking re-discovery of magic, long considered unfeasible by society at large and persecuted out of existence centuries ago.</p>

                        <p>With society being what it was at the time, precious few people outside of government agencies knew of these developments, or of the raw power that could be harnessed with them, until that power was brought to bear against them. When concrete information finally came to light about the discoveries, millions had already fallen in titanic struggles worldwide, the result of militaries across the globe testing the limits and applications of their new-found strength.</p>

                        <p>However, their meddling with the powers laying dormant within the planet has come at a great cost. Some once verdant areas of the land are fading away without warning or visible cause, to be reduced to deserted and arid areas. On top of this, those who most consistently exercised their magical prowess have found themselves suffering from a myriad of strange and incomprehensible effects: seemingly random loss of limbs, sudden blindness, occasionally bursting into flame, that sort of thing.</p>

                        <p>And then there's you. Once a prominent researcher at the Ley Line Research Facility, your life was turned upside down when you fell victim to an interesting, if maddening ailment - your hands, usually good for just about anything, now cause a noticeable increase in the rate at which non-natural objects degrade when held. This problem was discovered when an incredibly valuable ancient artifact crumbled to dust in your hands, costing the facility millions.</p>

                        <p>Now with nothing left to return to, you find yourself living off scraps and foraging in a cave system some distance away from the facility. Seeking to right some of the many wrongs committed by your colleagues and the people they now serve, you cobble together a crude weapon and head out into the ravaged world to mete out justice, one way or another.</p>

                        <div class="powerHeader">Combat Mechanics</div>

                        <p>Everything in the Realm is out to kill you, whether it's for survival or just because they don't like your face, so it's in your best interest to learn how fighting works. Each combatant will have two pieces of equipment to consider: their weapon, which dictates the amount and type of damage they will deal, and their armour, which dictates how much damage they will take. When looking at the 'Combat' tab, these items are laid out side by side, along with the combatant names and health pools.</p>

                        <p>When combat begins - initiated by the 'Look for something to kill' button - a target will be located for you, and then the two of you will begin trading blows until either you fall, the target falls, or you run away.</p>

                        <p>When attacking a target, the damage you deal is based on a few things:</p>
                        <ul>
                          <li>The attack damage on your weapon;</li>
                          <li>The value of the stat relating to your current weapon (Strength for melee, Dexterity for ranged, Intelligence for magic);</li>
                          <li>Any resistances or vulnerabilities on the target's armour;</li>
                          <li>Any powers that inflence damage dealt.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>And when your target decides to fight back, the damage they deal to you is based on a similar set of values:</p>
                        <ul>
                          <li>The attack damage on their weapon;</li>
                          <li>Their 'main stat' value (this plays the same role yours does in your damage calculation);</li>
                          <li>Any resistances or vulnerabilities on your armour;</li>
                          <li>Any powers that influence damage taken.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Your offensive options during combat are limited to fleeing, using a potion, and using a Burst Attack. The Burst Attack button is simply a single strike delivered instantly to the target, respecting all the usual rules regarding how much damage is dealt, as well as resetting the time delay between attacks.</p>

                        <p>When you are not in combat, your health regenerates based on your Constitution value. That value also increases the size of your maximum health pool, which is good for the whole 'not dying' thing.</p>

                        <div class="powerHeader">Debuffs</div>

                        <p>Weapons of particularly high quality will have a debuff attached to them. Each strike that is delivered with the weapon in combat has a 10% chance to apply the debuff to the target. If the debuff does damage to the target, that damage ignores any armour they are wearing. Note the ambiguity - your enemies can also take advantage of debuffs if they have a weapon that carries one, in the same way that you can.</p>

                        <p>A full listing of the debuffs in the game and their effects is available in the Store tab.</p>

                        <div class="powerHeader">Powers</div>

                        <p>The ability to break things by holding them isn't the only interesting ability you have access to - the Powers tab lists a number of additional effects that can apply to you and be honed and strengthened through the leveling process. You'll gain a point every level to spend on this tab, and most of the listed powers unlock additional subsidiaries once they reach maximum strength - although you can only level one subsidiary power at once. Located on this tab is also the 'Reset Powers' button - for a small fee of scrap based on total Power Points earned, you can clear your mind, and thus your power selection, and then re-assign points to your taste.</p>

                        <div class="powerHeader">Item Quality</div>

                        <p>The quality of items dictates several things: the number and strength of individual armour resistances and vulnerabilities, the damage ranges available on weapons, and the availability and potency of debuffs on weapons. There are six 'tiers' of quality, although only five of those are available to you. These tiers and their effects on equipment are as follows:<br /><br />

                          <span class="q221">Poor (grey)</span> items are the lowest quality of item.<br />
                          - Weapons of poor quality have 90% of their intended damage values.<br />
                          - Armours of poor quality carry 1 strength, and 2 vulnerabilities.<br />
                          <span class="q222">Normal (white)</span> items are the most common quality of item in the Realm<br />
                          - Weapons of normal quality have no distinguishing features.<br />
                          - Armours of normal quality carry 1 strength and 1 vulnerability.<br />
                          <span class="q223">Good (green)</span> items are a step above normal items.<br />
                          - Weapons of good quality have 110% of their intended damage values, as well as a normal debuff.<br />
                          - Armours of good quality carry 2 strengths and 1 vulnerability.<br />
                          <span class="q224">Great (blue)</span> items represent superior craftsmanship.<br />
                          - Weapons of great quality have 120% of their intended damage values, and also have unique names and flavour text, as well as a superior debuff.<br />
                          - Armours of great quality carry 2 strengths and no vulnerabilities.<br />
                          <span class="q225">Amazing (purple)</span> items represent the pinnacle of items obtainable in the Realm.<br />
                          - Weapons of amazing quality have 130% of their intended damage values, and also have unique names and flavour text, as well as a superior debuff.<br />
                          - Armours of amazing quality carry 3 strengths and no vulnerabilities.<br />
                          <span class="q226">Legendary (orange)</span> items are unique pieces made for specific bosses, and are not obtainable by players.<br />
                          - Weapons of legendary quality deal more damage and have more potent debuffs than even amazing weapons.<br />
                          - Armours of legendary quality are not strictly better than amazing armours - they instead serve to enforce a weakness on bosses for the player to take advantage of.</p>

                        <div class="powerHeader">Durability and Decay</div>

                        <p>All equipment has a set amount of durability - a measure of how close an item is to becoming unusable. When an item reaches 0 durability, its effect is diminished significantly: weapons have their damage output cut in half and can no longer apply their debuffs, and armour resistances no longer apply (although vulnerabilities still apply even when armour is broken).</p>

                        <p>To combat this, you have the ability to repair items. This is done at no cost, but takes time to complete based on your level and the level of the items being repaired. During the repair process, you are free to switch out items of equipment for other damaged items without interrupting the repairing procedure. Entering combat will halt the repair process if it is running.</p>

                        <div class="powerHeader">Items</div>

                        <p>The 'Items' tab plays host to a listing of all items you are currently carrying, and presents options as to how they can be used. Items can be freely equipped, sold, scrapped or discarded from this tab at any time, even during combat - worth remembering if you come up against an opponent whose weakness you can't exploit with your currently equipped weapon, or one who keeps taking advantage of a gap in your defences.</p>

                        <p>Selling an item rewards you with an amount of seeds (the currency of the Realm) based on that item's level and quality. Scrapping an item rewards you with a small amount of scrap based on the quality of the destroyed item. Both seeds and scrap are used in the Store to enhance or replace your equipment.</p>

                        <div class="powerHeader">The Store</div>

                        <p>The Store is your centralised hub for equipment enhancement or replacement. Here, you can perform the following actions:</p>
                        <ul>
                          <li>Spend seeds to increase the level of your equipped weapon and/or armour;</li>
                          <li>Spend seeds to purchase quality weapons and armour which may be otherwise difficult to find.</li>
                          <li>Spend scrap to increase the quality of your equipped weapon and/or armour;</li>
                          <li>Spend scrap to apply a debuff to your equipped weapon or replace it with a better one;</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>When purchasing item quality upgrades, raising the quality past certain thresholds causes additional things to happen. When an item is upgraded to 'Great' quality, you have the option of applying a custom name and piece of flavour text to that weapon. When upgrading a weapon specifically, it is granted a random debuff once it reaches 'Good' quality, which it retains through further quality upgrades unless it is replaced using the option in the Store. When upgrading armour, the distribution of strengths and vulnerabilities shifts, in accordance with the guides set in the 'Item Quality' section above.</p>

                        <p>Items upgraded using the Store cannot reach Legendary quality.</p>

                        <div class="powerHeader">Options</div>

                        <p>The 'Options' tab is home to a number of configuration options that didn't necessarily belong in other tabs, including controls for the auto-battle system, configuration options for the bulk sell and scrap buttons on the Items tab, and manual saving and resetting.</p>

                        <p>The auto-battle system is what makes this game semi-idle: it will attempt to initiate combat whenever your health is full, will flee from combat if you are close to death, repair items if they have broken or are close to doing so, and bulk sell or scrap items if your inventories get full.</p>

                        <p>The auto-battle system will not do certain things, though: It will not change your equipment for you, it will not attempt to upgrade or purchase new equipment in the Store, nor will it attempt to spend any of your Stat Points or Power Points for you. The auto-battle system will stop running automatically if either section of your inventory is full after the usual selling or scrapping has occured.</p>

                        <p><strong>Version 1.0 RC1</strong></p>
                        <p>Changes in this version:</p>
                        <ul>
                          <li>Repair Mechanics: <ul>
                            <li>The Repair function now restores a set amount of durability per second (5 plus 1 per 3 item levels).</li>
                            <li>Weapons and armour can now be freely exchanged while the repair function is running - the newly equipped items will be repaired instead.</li>
                            <li>The repair function will stop once both equipped items are fully repaired.</li>
                            <li>Entering combat is now possible while the repair operation is running - upon initiating combat, the repair function stops. The auto-battle function will still wait for repairs to conclude before entering combat.</li>
                          </ul></li>
                          <li>Zones and Enemy Changes<ul>
                            <li>Monsters that were previously considered 'bosses' are now considered 'elites'. The calculation of their stats and equipment remains the same as before.</li>
                            <li>The game world is now split into 12 distinct zones, whose inhabitants fit a certain level range (1-10, 11-20 etc.)</li>
                            <li>Each zone has a small piece of backstory, a specific set of enemies and a boss to encounter there.</li>
                            <li>A zone's boss is accessible once you reach the level cap for that zone.</li>
                            <li>Bosses have fixed stats higher than enemies in the zone, and specialised equipment that they do not drop on death.</li>
                            <li>Defeating a zone's boss is required to progress to the next zone.</li>
                          </ul></li>
                          <li>Tracking and Badges: <ul>
                            <li>A large number of stats and values are now tracked on the Player tab. Some of these include damage dealt (split by type), debuffs applied, sleeping foes awoken, win streak length, and many more.</li>
                            <li>Some of the tracked statistics are checked for earning badges - effectively achievements by another name.</li>
                            <li>Badges are one-time rewards for performing some in-game feats, of varying degrees of difficulty.</li>
                            <li>Each badge confers a 1% increase to experience and seed gains from combat.</li>
                          </ul></li>
                          <li>New Powers: <ul>
                            <li>'Reclaimed Knowledge' increases experience gained by up to 50% by draining the experience overflow pool. The experience overflow pool contains any surplus experience remaining when the player levels up with more experience than the level requires. This power has one rank and no pre-requisites.</li>
                            <li>'Master Tinkerer' increases the amount of durability restored per repair tick by 20% per rank. This power has 5 ranks available, requires maximum rank in 'Proper Care', and cannot be used alongside 'High Maintenance' or 'Hanging by a Thread'.</li>
                          </ul></li>
                          <li>The Store:<ul>
                            <li>The Store tab has been re-implemented and combined with the Forge, becoming a one-stop shop for equipment management and upgrades.</li>
                            <li>The store's stock consists of 6 weapons and 6 armour pieces of at least Good quality, with at least one guaranteed to be Great or better.</li>
                            <li>The store's stock of items is replenished when the player levels up.</li>
                            <li>Items in the store are priced at twice the amount required to upgrade an equivalent item of the same level and quality.</li>
                            <li>The 'Bartering' power affects the price of all store items.</li>
                          </ul></li>
                          <li>UI Changes: <ul>
                            <li>The game no longer runs in a fixed width configuration. There is a minimum width requirement of 825px and the game will fill the full width of the window where possible.</li>
                            <li>The tab bar is now placed permanently at the top of the game window, and features seed and scrap counters.</li>
                            <li>The sidebar on the left side has been removed.</li>
                            <li>Nearly all UI elements are now rendered as modular panels. When a tab contains a large number of panels, they will tile sideways to fit the browser window width.</li>
                            <li>Many tabs have had contents changed, as follows:<ul>
                              <li>Player (NEW) - Player information, stat point allocation, equipped items, game stats.</li>
                              <li>Combat - Fighter health bars, player information, enemy information, combat log.</li>
                              <li>Zones (NEW) - Listing of available zones and the means to switch between them.</li>
                              <li>Powers - List of available and selected powers, reset function.</li>
                              <li>Items - List of items held, inventory clean button.</li>
                              <li>Store - Item upgrade functions, debuff purchasing, buying items</li>
                              <li>Save, reset, prestige, autobattle configuration, bulk item actions.</li>
                              <li>Help - Information on game elements and mechanics.</li>
                              <li>Updates - Patch notes for game changes.</li>
                              <li>Badges (NEW) - Listing of badges, unearned badges are greyed out.</li>
                            </ul></li>
                            <li>A loading message now appears before all the scripts have initialised, showing which files have been loaded.</li>
                            <li>Toast notifications are now added to a queue instead of overriding each other. Each notification lasts 2 seconds.</li>
                            <li>Damage numbers and debuff/power names in the Combat Log are now shown in white instead of grey.</li>
                          </ul></li>
                          <li>Prestige:<ul>
                            <li>Player can, at any point after defeating the first zone boss, perform a prestige reset.</li>
                            <li>Upon prestiging, players will gain prestige level equal to their character's level before the reset.</li>
                            <li>The prestige level is added to all experience and seed gains from combat, after all other modifiers.</li>
                            <li>After a reset, the player gets 50% of their prestige level as stat points and 25% of their prestige level as power points (rounded down).</li>
                            <li>Badges and statistics are preserved across prestige resets. All currency and items are lost.</li>
                          </ul></li>
                          <li>Quality Of Life<ul>
                            <li>Buttons have been added to the stat point interface to assign up to 10 points per click.</li>
                            <li>The options in the autobattle interface now use percentile values.</li>
                            <li>A new set of options have been added for fine-grained control of the new 'Clean Inventory' button, which replaces the previous four management buttons on the Items tab.</li>
                            <li>The maximum size of the player's inventory is now 12 slots (up from 10)</li>
                            <li>Players can now reset their stat point allocations, at the cost of 1 scrap per 5 points assigned (rounded up).</li>
                          </ul></li>
                          <li>Balance Changes: <ul>
                            <li>The effects of the powers 'Luck of the Draw' and 'Lucky Star' have been swapped - 'Luck of the Draw' now provides the chance of a stat point, and 'Lucky Star' provides the chance of a power point.</li>
                            <li>Elites have had their experience and seed rewards reduced to 150% of the normal values (down from 200%).</li>
                            <li>The Constitution stat has had its effect boosted - it now provides an additional 15 health per assigned point on top of increasing per-level health gains.</li>
                            <li>Normal enemies now have less variation in the values for their main stats.</li>
                            <li>The experience curve has been considerably lowered.</li>
                            <li>The pricing curve for item level upgrades (and by extension item prices) has been considerably lowered.</li>
                          </ul></li>
                          <li>Bug Fixes: <ul>
                            <li>The activation of Reflective Shield or Absorption Shield will no longer trigge Divine Shield messages.</li>
                            <li>Fixed some edge cases where the Wild Swings ending message would appear in the wrong place.</li>
                            <li>Fixed an issue where the auto-battle routine would attempt to run away from combat while sleeping and spam notifications.</li>
                            <li>Fixed an issue wherein the automatic clearing of the inventory by the auto-battle function was not triggering.</li>
                          </ul></li>
                          <li>Miscellaneous Changes<ul>

                          </ul></li>
                          <li>Known Issues<ul>
                            <li>The badges 'Trust Me, I'm a Doctor', 'Dirty Tactics', 'Potion Hoarder' and 'Full House' are not currently attainable due to the postponement of the Potions mechanic.</li>
