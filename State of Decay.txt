Ranged: 'Infected Wound' - Reduces the damage done by the target by (level) per stack.

Magic: 'Residual Burn' - Increases the target's damage taken by (level) per stack.
	Special: 'Wild Magic' - Instantly fires 1 attack per stack of 'Residual Burn', after which all stacks are removed.

Enemies
-------

Randomly generated, with level equal to the player's level and a random weapon of any type, of the same level or up to 2 levels higher.
Upon defeat, the player can, at their option, take the enemy weapon as their own.
Experience granted upon defeat equals 20 + (5*level) to (6*level)

Bosses
------

Starting at player level 5, there is a 1% chance that a generated enemy will be a boss enemy - this enemy is guaranteed to have a weapon 3 levels higher than them, and their stats are generated using the player algorithm (higher across the board)
Bosses give double the highest possible XP from a normal encounter of the same level.

Fleeing
-------

If an enemy proves too strong for your character, you have the option to flee from combat. This does not incur a penalty.

Death
-----

If the player loses to their enemy, they lose 25% of the experience they have gained towards the next level, and are healed back to full health. 
Additionally, any equipped weapon will become 'decayed' (see below)

Decay
-----

Each weapon hit in combat contributes to weapon decay. Faster weapons will decay more quickly than slower weapons.
Weapons can deal 50 hits in combat before decaying completely and needing repair.
A decayed weapon will only function at half effectiveness until it is repaired. The repair process takes one regen tick per weapon level, during which time the player is unable to initiate combat.
A partially damaged weapon can also be repaired, as above. 
Magical weapons do not decay, but have lower damage to compensate.

Game Flow
---------

At the start of the game, the player is given a randomly generated level 1 weapon.
When not in combat, there is a once per second regen tick which restores health equal to 20% of your constitution, rounded down.
Combat can be initiated with the 'Look for something to kill' button. 

Combat Flow
-----------

Once combat begins, the first attacker is randomly decided, and the second attacker starts one second later. 
Each combatant then attacks at the interval decided by their weapon speed, dealing weapon damage plus half the relevant stat (Str for melee, Dex for ranged, Int for magic) every interval, rounded down.
The fight ends when either combatant is reduced to 0 HP (or lower)

Levelling Up
------------

When the player gains a level, they gain additional stat points by default, plus they are granted an additional free stat point to allocate wherever they wish.
