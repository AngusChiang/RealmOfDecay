Weapon Specialities
-------------------

Melee: 'Deep Wound' - Deals (weapon level) additional damage per strike, per stack.
	Special: 'Bloodthirst' - Heals you for 10% of your health per stack of 'Bleeding' on the target.

Ranged: 'Infected Wound' - Reduces the damage done by the target by (weapon level) per stack.
	Special: 'Power Shot' - Consumes all stacks of 'Infected Wound' to deal 10% health damage per stack, rounded down.

Magic: 'Residual Burn' - Increases the target's damage taken by (weapon level) per stack.
	Special: 'Wild Magic' - Instantly fires 1 attack per stack of 'Residual Burn', after which all stacks are removed. These attacks may add 'Residual Burn' stacks, but any additional stacks do not trigger another extra attack from 'Wild Magic'.

Enemies
-------

Randomly generated, with level equal to the player's level and a random weapon of any type, of the same level or one level higher.
Upon defeat, the player can, at their option, take the enemy weapon as their own.
Experience granted upon defeat equals 20 + ((4*level) - (5*level))

Bosses
------

Starting at player level 5, there is a 1% chance that a generated enemy will be a boss enemy - this enemy is guaranteed to have a weapon 3 levels higher than them, and their stats are generated using the player algorithm (higher across the board) and their health is doubled.
Bosses give double the highest possible XP from a normal encounter of the same level.

Fleeing
-------

If an enemy proves too strong for your character, you have the option to flee from combat. This does not incur a penalty.

Death
-----

If the player loses to their enemy, they lose 25% of the experience they have gained towards the next level, and are healed back to full health. 
Additionally, any equipped weapon will become 'decayed' (see below)

Decay
-----

Each weapon hit in combat contributes to weapon decay. Faster weapons will decay more quickly than slower weapons.
Weapons can deal 100+5*(level-1) hits in combat before decaying completely and needing repair.
A decayed weapon will only function at half effectiveness until it is repaired. The repair process takes one regen tick per weapon level, during which time the player is unable to initiate combat.
A partially damaged weapon can also be repaired, as above. 
Magical weapons do not decay, but have lower damage to compensate.

Game Flow
---------

At the start of the game, the player is given a randomly generated level 1 weapon.
When not in combat, there is a once per second regen tick which restores health equal to your constitution.
Combat can be initiated with the 'Look for something to kill' button. 
There will be an 'auto-combat' button for idlers that will trigger combat whenever your player's health fills to maximum.

Combat Flow
-----------

Once combat begins, the first attacker is randomly decided, and the second attacker starts one second later. 
Each combatant then attacks at the interval decided by their weapon speed, dealing weapon damage plus half the relevant stat (Str for melee, Dex for ranged, Int for magic) every interval, rounded down.
After each attack by the player, there is a 20% chance to apply the weapon's speciality effect, which stacks indefinitely.
The player can also activate a special ability, again depending on weapon type. This will apply instantly, regardless of weapon attack speed.
The fight ends when either combatant is reduced to 0 HP

Levelling Up
------------

When the player gains a level, they gain additional stat points by default, plus they are granted an additional free stat point to allocate wherever they wish. 
Weapons do not level with the player.

Power Points
------------
Unlock one power point per 5 levels. Each one can only be selected once.
